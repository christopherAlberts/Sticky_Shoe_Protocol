# Sticky_Shoee_Protocol 

Gathers all systems info from a Windows Computer. Including Wifi passwords, DNS cache, file tree, all installed programs, all currently running programs, all open ports as well as the local ip and mac-address to name but a few. 

This program was designed to be deployed via USB. (Plug the usb in to the computer and run the jar file. 

The program takes between 10 and 15 seconds to run. Deering this time it will display NO PROGRESS BAR. It will give no indication that anything is happening other than appearance of a new .bat file in the same directory as the .jar file. As you might have thought, this .bat file contains all the gathered systems info. 

**DO NOT CLICK ON THE BAT FILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**   

When the program runs, it not only saves all the info to the .bat file. It also creates a Seppuku Protocol. What this means is that when the .bat file is clicked it will not only kill itself, but the .jar file and the needed WifiInfo.ps1 file.  

This will act as a fail save to insure that only those who know how the program works can get to the data in question.  

The only way to view the .bat file is to "right click" on it, and open it with a text editor like notepad++.
